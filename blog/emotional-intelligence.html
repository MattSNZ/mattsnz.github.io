              <p class="has-text-justified">At times, the core learning has felt like a distraction from the tech learning. Reminding myself that I&#39;m not hear to just learn the technology but actually how to <em>be a great developer</em> helps me move through that.</p>

                Development is a constantly shifting field. What was common 10, or even 5, years ago is now passé so learning how to implement the new shiny framework or updated standards is incredibly important.

              <p class="has-text-justified">
                I don&#39;t think so. Some of it was rehashing previously learned things for me, but it was good to go over them again in the context of development. I think my previous answer about the shifting sands of web development justifies this feeling quite well.

      <h3>Can I improve?</h3>
      <p>
        The good news is that your brain is amazing. It has the power to learn anything you want. Three things to focus on if you want to improve your EQ are:
      </p>
      <ul class="actual-list">
        <li>
          <h4>Listen:</h4>
          <p>Take the time to listen to what people are trying to tell you, both verbally and non-verbally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Empathise:</h4>
          <p>Picking up on emotions is critical, but you also need to be able to put yourself into someone else's shoes in order to truly understand their point of view.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Question:</h4>
          <p>
            Consider how your own emotions influence your decisions and behaviors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why is this person feeling this way? Are there any unseen factors that might be contributing to these feelings? How to your emotions differ from theirs?
          </p>
