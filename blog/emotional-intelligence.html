            <h1 class="title is-2 has-text-centered">Emotional Intelligence</h1>
            <h3 class="title is-5 has-text-centered">What is EQ?</h3>
            <p>Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the term used to the group of abilities used to recognise, control, and assess emotions. While some people naturally have high levels of EQ, the good news is that it is also something that can be learned.</p>
            <p>In some ways, we can compare EQ with IQ in that they are both ways of measuring the elements of our brains' aptitude. IQ is definitely more well-known and is, problematically, often referred to as the be-all of intelligence measurement. One
              of the main issues with IQ in this respect is that almost all tests were developed with a very Eurocentric view of the world and ignore large cultural differences that can cause those from other cultures to perform poorly. IQ also fails
              in that it doesn't take into account how a person interacts with the people around them. This is where EQ shines.</p>

            <h3 class="title is-5 has-text-centered">EQ at Work</h3>
            <p>The modern workplace is a highly collaborative place. Whether within your team, across internal teams, other companies, or with customers, you spend a lot of time dealing with people. Research related to this in the tech industry has shown
              that there are six factors that tend to separate the top performers from the rest. Of these six, four are closely associated with <span class="eq-text">EQ</span> and only two relate to <span class="iq-text">IQ</span>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="eq-text">Achievement Drive and Standards;</li>
              <li class="eq-text">Influence;</li>
              <li class="iq-text">Conceptual Thinking;</li>
              <li class="eq-text">Initiative;</li>
              <li class="iq-text">Analytical Ability; and</li>
              <li class="eq-text">Self-Confidence</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              With this research in mind it's no surprise that high performing workplaces prefer employees with high levels of EQ, to go alongside their technical abilities. Despite some highly questionable other HR practices, Netflix has long maintained that they
              harbour no interest in <em>"brilliant jerks"</em> for their teams. This quote is taken directly from the <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture#dream-team" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Culture page of their hiring site</a>:
              <blockquote>
                On a dream team, there are no “brilliant jerks.” The cost to teamwork is just too high. Our view is that brilliant people are also capable of decent human interactions, and we insist upon that. When highly capable people work together in a collaborative
                context, they inspire each other to be more creative, more productive and ultimately more successful as a team than they could be as a collection of individuals.
              </blockquote>
              <p> Similarly, Atlassian has an established policy not to hire these "brilliant jerks" and their <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/hr-teams/our-performance-reviews-framework" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">performance reviews are structured</a>                so that these employees will not be able to artifically shine across all areas of the review.

            <h3 class="title is-5 has-text-centered">Can I improve?</h3>
            <p>The good news is that your brain is amazing. It has the power to learn anything you want. Three things to focus on if you want to improve your EQ are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><span class="has-text-weight-semibold">Listen:</span>Take the time to listen to what people are trying to tell you, both verbally and non-verbally.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><span class="has-text-weight-semibold">Empathise:</span> Picking up on emotions is critical, but you also need to be able to put yourself into someone else's shoes in order to truly understand their point of view.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="has-text-justified mb-1"><span class="has-text-weight-semibold">Question:</span> Consider how your own emotions influence your decisions and behaviors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Why is this person feeling this way? Are there any unseen factors that might be contributing to these feelings? How to your emotions differ from theirs?
                </p>
