            <h1 class="title is-2 has-text-centered">Identity & Values</h1>
            <h3 class="title is-5 has-text-centered">Personal Values</h3>
            <p class="has-text-justified">My core personal values are kindness, generosity, and curiosity. I enjoy learning new things, from large undertakings like EDA to random Wikipedia rabbitholes about history or arts. I strongly believe that, until shown otherwise, we should
              provide people with the benefit of the doubt about their intentions etc.</p>

            <p class="has-text-justified">In the past, I was offered a job with an ad-tech company. It was a significant promotion (and pay-rise!) from the job I was doing at the time. However, I'm a firm believer in the power of privacy and believe that ad-tech in general is not
              a force for good in this world. I had to weigh up whether or not I felt that the money and prestige was worth it, whether I felt like I could change the culture from the inside, and if I would feel OK helping people (the job was in customer
              support) take advantage of others' naivete. Ultimately, I turned the job down. As a result, I continued at a lower salary and my career took longer to get to where I would have been with that role.</p>

            <p class="has-text-justified">I grew in a strongly religious household. However, we were also raised to question <em>why</em> things were and not to just blindly follow. Because of this, (and for a variety of other reasons) I'm no longer religious but I do find a lot of
              peace in reading the bible. My values of kindness and generosity directly flow from this part of my culture and upbringing.</p>

            <h3 class="title is-5 has-text-centered">Strengths & Limitations</h3>

            <p class="has-text-justified">I've learned from the research I did for this was that my key strengths are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>My love of learning and willingness to be wrong;</li>
              <li>My empathy for others;</li>
              <li>My ability to solve problems; and</li>
              <li>My ability to see the big picture.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="has-text-justified">These have helped me in my career by allowing me not to be phased by new technology or processes but to take them on with gusto. As a customer support professional, empathy for your customers and users is paramount.</p>

            <p class="has-text-justified">These are not without limitations, however. Being too focussed on the big picture has caused me to miss important details that were very relevant to what I was working on. Sometimes too much empathy can cause burn-out or cause you to focus
              too tightly on a single customers' problem but miss the forest.</p>

            <p class="has-text-justified">My love of learning and curiosity is definitely the most helpful of these for my learning journey, as I find real joy in tinkering with a problem and the lessons that come out of it. My problem-solving strength will also be useful here as
              well.
            </p>

            <p class="has-text-justified"></p>At one old job, I was responsible for an update of how we measured our customer satisfaction. I had to work across several departments in order to get it completed. The hardest part was convincing the company executives and board that
            our current (soon to be "old") way of doing it was essentially useless. I wasn't very successful, but I was persistent. I managed to get the new system in place by browbeating them with statistics that this was the best way to be surveying
            our customers. However, within months of leaving that job, the old system was back in place.</p>

            <p class="has-text-justified">I recognise now that I didn't spend enough time educating those stakeholders on why the new system was better and how to interpret the results of the surveys. Today, I'd spend more time walking through the steps to do just that.</p>
