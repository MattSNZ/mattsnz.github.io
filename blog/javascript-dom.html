            <h3 class="subtitle is-5 has-text-centered">How a Website Works</h3>

            <p class="has-text-justified">Modern websites exist, at their simplest level, as a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Imagine that a website is a person. In that context, HTML would be their body - the content of who they are. Without HTML there would be no person
              but they'd also just lie there, naked and not doing anything. CSS would be the person's clothes, what colour, how large their clothes are - that sort of thing. More interesting, but still just lying there. JavaScript then defines how that
              person would interact with the world. How they react to inputs, like do they laugh when tickled? Do they eat when they're hungry?
            </p>
            <p class="has-text-justified">When building a website, it's important to keep the Control Flow in mind. Control Flow is the order in which things happen - like a recipe for the website. Like a recipe, it's important for things to happen in a certain order - you can't scramble
              an egg if you haven't cracked it open yet! Some steps in the control flow need to be repeated until they're done - these are called loops. In a recipe you might have a step that says to slice a tomato - you might not realise this, but that's
              a loop! We don't just run the knife through the tomato once, we do it enough times that we have sliced the tomato at the thickness that we want. We <code>do</code> the slicing <code>while</code> there's still tomato remaining.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/tomatoes.gif" width="50%" class="image is-align-self-center">
            <div class="block"></div>
            <p class="has-text-justified">The JavaScript interacts with the plain old HTML of a website is through the Document Object Model, or DOM. Through the DOM, we can find and and interact with every single thing on the page (even the page itself) - adding, changing, and removing
              things seemingly at will. Want to make it so that when you click a button it changes the meaning of every sentence on the page? We can do that with the DOM.
            </p>
            <p class="has-text-justified">One of the key things that JavaScript uses in order to make the interactions possible called a <strong>Function</strong>. Functions are pieces of code that tell the website to do a thing, and are often repeatable in different parts of the
              page. Going to back to the recipe analogy, each step of the recipe would be a function. Functions can be called as part of a loop - slice with knife would be a function; slice a whole tomato is the related loop - and can also be included
              as a part of other functions - slice one way then turn and slice again aka dice an onion would be a function made up of functions. By implementing these repeatable and reuseable pieces of code we are able to make the webpage incredibly interactive
              for the user.</p>
