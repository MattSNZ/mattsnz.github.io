            <h3 class="subtitle is-5 has-text-centered">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
            <p>Studies have shown that even being simply aware of the concept of neuroplasticity can have an effect of the ability of a learner to succeed in the classroom! Knowing that our brains are far more capable than we had previously imagined is great
              for us! We want to be turning neural pathways into neural highways with lots of practice.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-5 has-text-centered">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
            <p>I&#39;m intending to start each day by reviewing the previous days&#39; work and maybe undertaking some simple problems in order to tread in the neurons.</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-5 has-text-centered">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
            <p>Neuroplastic change requires 5 components:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Challenge &amp; novelty</li>
              <li>Intention</li>
              <li>Specific attention</li>
              <li>Repetition &amp; intensity</li>
              <li>Time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Begin by selecting an activity that is new, challenging and important to you. Commit yourself to engaging in the exercise as frequently as you can.</p>
            <p>Even something as simple as brushing your teeth with the opposite hand or buying groceries at a different store can help encourage neuroplastic change!</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-5 has-text-centered">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
            <p>A growth mindset is the understanding that our brains are capable of learning and growing for our entire lives. No subject is &quot;too hard&quot;, it just hasn&#39;t been introduced in the right context. This is very relevant to us at EDA,
              because we&#39;re undertaking new learning about web development!</p>

            <h3 class="subtitle is-5 has-text-centered">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
            <p>Not really - I&#39;ve attended a number of personal development courses for work in the past and they all love a good growth mindset session.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="block">
            <h3 class="subtitle is-5 has-text-centered">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
            <p>I already do this a lot with my kids! When you get deep into the &quot;why?&quot; questions, eventually you get to a point where you don&#39;t know - I respond by saying &quot;I don&#39;t know yet! Let&#39;s find out!&quot; </p>
            <p>Ensuring that I stay curious will be the most important part of integrating a growth mindset into my journey.</p>
