              <h3 class="title is-5 has-text-centered">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">
              <p class="has-text-justified">The first thing I&#39;ve learned is that I need to trick myself into learning things that seem unappealing to me at first, however once I&#39;m started I&#39;ll happily dive into all manner of rabbitholes within the topic at hand. </p>
              <p class="has-text-justified">The second thing, which isn&#39;t just me but amazed me anyway, was that <em>simply knowing about neuroplasticity</em> has a benefit on learning. It makes sense in a way, I guess. Knowing that your brain <strong>is capable</strong> of learning
                all manner of new things is bound to help you learn them.</p>
              <p class="has-text-justified">Finally, I&#39;ve learned that I really need to stay on top of my focus. If I let it drift from the intention of what I&#39;m working, it can be gone for a long time. Setting myself up for success here is key! Closing or hiding distracting
                browser windows and/or Slack/disabling notifications etc are key.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
              <h3 class="title is-5 has-text-centered">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">
              <p class="has-text-justified">We&#39;ve seen over the last few years what can happen when people write code without values. Just because we can, definitely doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that we should. Empathy and self-awareness are very important for building websites
                and/or applications that are usable by many people and not just the most technologically literate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
              <h3 class="title is-5 has-text-centered">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">
              <p class="has-text-justified">Other than the benefits of learning about neuroplasticity, the thing that has surprised me the most has been the benefits of pseudocode. Now I just need to remind myself to use it more frequently!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
              <h3 class="title is-5 has-text-centered">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">
              <p class="has-text-justified">At times, the core learning has felt like a distraction from the tech learning. Reminding myself that I&#39;m not hear to just learn the technology but actually how to <em>be a great developer</em> helps me move through that.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
              <h3 class="title is-5 has-text-centered">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">
              <p class="has-text-justified">
                Development is a constantly shifting field. What was common 10, or even 5, years ago is now pass√© so learning how to implement the new shiny framework or updated standards is incredibly important.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
              <h3 class="title is-5 has-text-centered">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3 class="title is-3 has-text-centered">
              <p class="has-text-justified">
                I don&#39;t think so. Some of it was rehashing previously learned things for me, but it was good to go over them again in the context of development. I think my previous answer about the shifting sands of web development justifies this feeling quite well.
